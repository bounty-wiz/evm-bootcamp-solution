1. If your bot fails because “the state for this block is unavailable”, what’s the most likely cause?

You are querying historical state on a non-archive node.
The node pruned that state and cannot reconstruct it.

⸻

2. If you need guaranteed access to deep historical state, which node type must you use?

An archive node.

3. Why are bots and aggregators usually connected to multiple RPC providers at once?

To:
	•	avoid downtime
	•	bypass rate limits
	•	compare responses
	•	reduce risk of stale or missing data
	•	fail over automatically

Production systems never trust a single RPC.

4. Your script gets rate-limited on a provider’s public endpoint. What are your options?
	•	upgrade to a paid plan
	•	add multiple providers
	•	self-host a node
	•	batch requests
	•	cache aggressively
	•	slow down request rate

⸻

5. What is the risk of relying only on a single RPC provider in production?
	•	outages break your app
	•	rate limits halt your system
	•	inconsistent data goes unnoticed
	•	censorship or filtering can affect results

Single RPC = single point of failure.
