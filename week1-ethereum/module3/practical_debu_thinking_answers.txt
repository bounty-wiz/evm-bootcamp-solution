1. A user complains your dApp shows 0 balance, even though Etherscan shows they have funds.

Three RPC-related reasons:
	1.	You’re querying a different chain (wrong network / RPC)
	2.	The RPC node is behind or desynced
	3.	You’re querying historical state on a pruned node

⸻

2. Your transaction gets stuck in “pending” forever.

Could RPC differences be involved? Explain.

Yes:
	•	your RPC accepted the tx but didn’t propagate it well
	•	other nodes never saw it
	•	replacement or dropped tx due to low gas
	•	mempools are local, not global

Different RPCs may see different pending states.

3. Your call works on Alchemy but fails on Chainstack.

What’s the first thing you check?
	1.	Node type (archive vs full)
	2.	Block number you’re querying
	3.	Whether the method (debug_traceCall, etc.) is supported
	4.	Pruning / rate limit errors
