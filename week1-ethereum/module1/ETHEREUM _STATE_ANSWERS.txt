ETHEREUM STATE — Check Your Understanding

1. What is “Ethereum’s world state” in your own words?

The world state is the current snapshot of all accounts in Ethereum, including:
	•	balances
	•	nonces
	•	contract code
	•	contract storage

It represents “who owns what and what contracts currently store”.

⸻

2. Why isn’t the world state stored directly on the blockchain?

Because it’s extremely large and constantly changing.
Instead, Ethereum stores a cryptographic commitment (the state root) so nodes can reconstruct and verify the state without bloating blocks.

⸻

3. When does the world state change?

The world state changes every time a transaction is executed and modifies:
	•	balances
	•	nonces
	•	contract storage
	•	contract creation

⸻

4. What does the stateRoot in a block header represent?

The stateRoot is the root hash of the state trie after all transactions in that block have been executed.
It uniquely commits to the entire Ethereum world state at that block.
