MERKLE TREES — Check Your Understanding

1. What happens to the root hash if you change one byte in one leaf of a Merkle tree?

Changing one byte in a leaf changes that leaf’s hash, which then changes every parent hash up to the root.
As a result, the root hash becomes completely different (avalanche effect).


2. Why does Ethereum store only the root hash of a trie in the block header instead of the entire dataset?

Because the root hash cryptographically commits to the entire dataset.
Storing only the root:
	•	keeps block headers small
	•	allows verification of any part of the data using proofs
	•	avoids duplicating massive state data in every block


3. What problem do Merkle proofs solve?

Merkle proofs allow someone to prove that a specific piece of data is included in a large dataset without revealing or downloading the entire dataset.


4. How does a Merkle tree help light clients verify data without downloading everything?

A light client receives:
	•	the block header (containing the root hash)
	•	a Merkle proof for specific data

Using the proof, it can verify inclusion cryptographically, without storing the full state or history.
