3. What is the purpose of the nonce field?

The nonce:
	•	enforces transaction ordering per sender
	•	prevents replay of old transactions
	•	ensures each transaction is unique

4. What role do the fields v, r, and s play?

They form the ECDSA signature proving that the transaction was authorized by the sender’s private key.
From them, the sender address can be recovered.

5. What does the data field contain when interacting with a contract?

The data field contains:
