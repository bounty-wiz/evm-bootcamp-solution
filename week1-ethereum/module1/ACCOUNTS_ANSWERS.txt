ACCOUNTS — Check Your Understanding

1. What is the main difference between an EOA and a contract account?
	•	EOA (Externally Owned Account): controlled by a private key
	•	Contract account: controlled by code executed by the EVM

EOAs initiate transactions; contracts cannot on their own.

⸻

2. Which account fields can change over time? Which one cannot?

Can change:
	•	balance
	•	nonce
	•	storageRoot

Cannot change:
	•	codeHash

⸻

3. Why is codeHash immutable, and what practical consequence does that have for bugs?

codeHash is immutable because deployed contract code cannot be altered.
Practical consequence: bugs in deployed contracts are permanent, requiring redeployment or proxy patterns to fix.

⸻

4. What happens to an EOA’s nonce when it sends a transaction?

The nonce increments by 1 after each transaction, ensuring:
	•	correct transaction ordering
	•	protection against replay attacks
